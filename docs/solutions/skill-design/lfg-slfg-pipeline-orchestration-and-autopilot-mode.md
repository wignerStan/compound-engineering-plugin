# Collapsing `slfg` into `lfg` and Making Autopilot Explicit

## Scope Note

This doc captures the first durable orchestration shift:

- collapse `slfg` into `lfg`
- stop inferring autopilot from caller prose
- make swarm an implementation-mode choice instead of a separate top-level workflow

That learning is still correct, but it is no longer the whole contract.

The current runtime model also depends on:

- a resumable manifest
- route-aware resume logic (`direct | lightweight | full`)
- explicit gate ownership across downstream skills
- stale late-stage invalidation for review / verification / wrap-up

For the current end-to-end runtime model, see:

- [How lfg autopilot orchestration, resumability, and the manifest contract work](./lfg-autopilot-orchestration-and-resumability.md)

## Problem

The original `lfg` / `slfg` split created two orchestration problems:

1. autopilot was described in caller prose, so downstream skills had to guess when they were in an automated run
2. `slfg` carried a second top-level workflow contract even though the real distinction was only whether implementation used swarm/agent-team behavior

As `lfg` evolved into a resume-anywhere orchestrator, that split stopped making sense. The durable pattern is not "two top-level workflows with slightly different chaining." The durable pattern is:

- one top-level orchestrator: `lfg`
- one explicit autopilot contract: marker + manifest
- one implementation-mode distinction inside `lfg`: `standard | swarm`

## Investigation

### What broke down in the old model

- `ce:brainstorm`, `ce:plan`, and other workflow skills originally inferred autopilot from wording like "called from `lfg` / `slfg`"
- that made the pipeline brittle: handoff menus, post-generation prompts, and branch questions were skipped inconsistently
- resuming work from a later stage was awkward because the orchestrator had no shared run state
- the `slfg` branch of the model encouraged people to attach special behavior to the wrapper itself instead of to the underlying execution context

The old split also obscured the real decision boundary: swarm is an implementation coordination choice, not a separate end-to-end workflow identity.

## Solution

The current pattern is:

1. `lfg` is the only top-level autopilot entrypoint
2. `lfg` creates or backfills a run-scoped manifest under `.context/compound-engineering/autopilot/<run-id>/`
3. `lfg` passes an explicit marker downstream:
   - `[ce-autopilot manifest=.../session.json] :: <normal input>`
4. downstream skills detect autopilot from that marker + manifest, not from caller wording
5. swarm lives behind `lfg` as `implementation_mode: standard | swarm`
6. `slfg` is only a deprecated compatibility path; it should not own separate orchestration rules

This lets `lfg` do two things the old model could not do well:

- resume from the first unmet workflow gate instead of assuming every run starts at ideation
- choose behavior from actual execution context (manifest state, implementation mode, current gate) rather than from the name of the top-level command

The current contract goes further than the original `lfg`/`slfg` collapse:

- direct and lightweight routes also create manifests
- the manifest is validated and repaired on resume instead of being blindly trusted
- later gates are kept explicit so an open PR does not masquerade as "done"

## Key Design Decisions

### One orchestrator, many modes

The durable abstraction is not "sequential workflow vs swarm workflow." It is:

- one orchestrator
- one shared run contract
- multiple execution choices inside that orchestrator

That keeps workflow semantics stable while allowing implementation behavior to vary.

### Explicit runtime beats prose inference

The autopilot marker + manifest pattern is more work than prose like "when called from `lfg`," but it is much safer. It prevents stale caller assumptions, gives skills a stable contract to read, and creates a place to accumulate run artifacts like decision logs.

### Compatibility wrappers should be thin

Once a wrapper is deprecated, it should stop accumulating behavior. If a compatibility command remains, it should route into the canonical command immediately rather than carrying a second copy of orchestration policy.

## Prevention

- When a workflow is split only by execution style, prefer one canonical orchestrator plus an internal mode switch over two top-level commands
- When downstream behavior depends on automation context, add an explicit runtime contract instead of inferring from caller wording
- Keep deprecated wrappers thin; do not let them become alternate policy surfaces
- Test the orchestration contract directly with contract tests, not only by reviewing the individual skill text
