## [2.39.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- **ce:compound context budget precheck** — Warns when context is constrained and offers compact-safe mode to avoid compaction mid-compound ([#235](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/pull/235))
- **ce:plan daily sequence numbers** — Plan filenames now include a 3-digit daily sequence number (e.g., `2026-03-10-001-feat-...`) to prevent collisions ([#238](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/pull/238))
- **ce:review serial mode** — Pass `--serial` flag (or auto-detects when 6+ agents configured) to run review agents sequentially, preventing context limit crashes ([#237](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/pull/237))
- **agent-browser inspection & debugging commands** — Added JS eval, console/errors, network, storage, device emulation, element debugging, recording/tracing, tabs, and advanced mouse commands to agent-browser skill ([#236](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/pull/236))
- **test-browser port detection** — Auto-detects dev server port from CLAUDE.md, package.json, or .env files; supports `--port` flag ([#233](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/pull/233))
- **lfg phase gating** — Added explicit GATE checks between /lfg steps to enforce plan-before-work ordering ([#231](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/pull/231))

### Fixed

- **Context7 API key auth** — MCP server config now passes `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` via `x-api-key` header to avoid anonymous rate limits ([#232](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/pull/232))
- **CLI: MCP server merge order** — `sync` now correctly overwrites same-named MCP servers with plugin values instead of preserving stale entries

### Removed

- **every-style-editor agent** — Removed duplicate agent; functionality already exists as `every-style-editor` skill ([#234](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/pull/234))

### Contributors

- Matt Van Horn ([@mvanhorn](https://x.com/mvanhorn)) — PRs #231–#238

---

## [2.38.1] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **Cross-platform `AskUserQuestion` fallback** — `setup` skill and `create-new-skill`/`add-workflow` workflows now include an "Interaction Method" preamble that instructs non-Claude LLMs (Codex, Gemini, Copilot, Kiro) to use numbered lists instead of `AskUserQuestion`, preventing silent auto-configuration. ([#204](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/issues/204))
- **Codex AGENTS.md `AskUserQuestion` mapping** — Strengthened from "ask the user in chat" to structured numbered-list guidance with multi-select support and a "never skip or auto-configure" rule.
- **Skill compliance checklist** — Added `AskUserQuestion` lint rule to `CLAUDE.md` to prevent recurrence.

---

## [2.38.0] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- `workflows:plan`, `workflows:work`, `workflows:review`, `workflows:brainstorm`, `workflows:compound` renamed to `ce:plan`, `ce:work`, `ce:review`, `ce:brainstorm`, `ce:compound` for clarity — the `ce:` prefix unambiguously identifies these as compound-engineering commands

### Deprecated
- `workflows:*` commands — all five remain functional as aliases that forward to their `ce:*` equivalents with a deprecation notice. Will be removed in a future version.

---

## [2.37.2] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **CLI: auto-detect install targets** — `bunx @every-env/compound-plugin install compound-engineering --to all` auto-detects installed AI coding tools and installs to all of them in one command. ([#191](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/pull/191))
- **CLI: Gemini sync** — `sync --target gemini` symlinks personal skills to `.gemini/skills/` and merges MCP servers into `.gemini/settings.json`. ([#191](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/pull/191))
- **CLI: sync defaults to `--target all`** — Running `sync` with no target now syncs to all detected tools automatically. ([#191](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/pull/191))

---

## [2.37.1] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **`/workflows:review` rendering** — Fixed broken markdown output: "Next Steps" items 3 & 4 and Severity Breakdown no longer leak outside the Summary Report template, section numbering fixed (was jumping 5→7, now correct), removed orphaned fenced code block delimiters that caused the entire End-to-End Testing section to render as a code block, and fixed unclosed quoted string in section 1. ([#214](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/pull/214)) — thanks [@XSAM](https://github.com/XSAM)!
- **`.worktrees` gitignore** — Added `.worktrees/` to `.gitignore` to prevent worktree directories created by the `git-worktree` skill from being tracked. ([#213](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/pull/213)) — thanks [@XSAM](https://github.com/XSAM)!

## [2.37.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **`proof` skill** — Create, edit, comment on, and share markdown documents via Proof's web API and local bridge. Supports document creation, track-changes suggestions, comments, and bulk rewrites. No authentication required for creating shared documents.
- **Optional Proof sharing in `/workflows:brainstorm`** — "Share to Proof" is now a menu option in Phase 4 handoff, letting you upload the brainstorm document when you want to, rather than automatically on every run.
- **Optional Proof sharing in `/workflows:plan`** — "Share to Proof" is now a menu option in Post-Generation Options, letting you upload the plan file on demand rather than automatically.

---

## [2.36.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **OpenClaw install target** — `bunx @every-env/compound-plugin install compound-engineering --to openclaw` now installs the plugin to OpenClaw's extensions directory. ([#217](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/pull/217)) — thanks [@TrendpilotAI](https://github.com/TrendpilotAI)!
- **Qwen Code install target** — `bunx @every-env/compound-plugin install compound-engineering --to qwen` now installs the plugin to Qwen Code's extensions directory. ([#220](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/pull/220)) — thanks [@rlam3](https://github.com/rlam3)!
- **Windsurf install target** — `bunx @every-env/compound-plugin install compound-engineering --to windsurf` converts plugins to Windsurf format. Agents become Windsurf skills, commands become flat workflows, and MCP servers write to `mcp_config.json`. Defaults to global scope (`~/.codeium/windsurf/`); use `--scope workspace` for project-level output. ([#202](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/pull/202)) — thanks [@rburnham52](https://github.com/rburnham52)!

### Fixed

- **`create-agent-skill` / `heal-skill` YAML crash** — `argument-hint` values containing special characters now properly quoted to prevent YAML parse errors in the Claude Code TUI. ([#219](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/pull/219)) — thanks [@solon](https://github.com/solon)!
- **`resolve-pr-parallel` skill name** — Renamed from `resolve_pr_parallel` (underscore) to `resolve-pr-parallel` (hyphen) to match the standard naming convention. ([#202](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/pull/202)) — thanks [@rburnham52](https://github.com/rburnham52)!

## [2.35.2] - 2026-02-20

### Changed

- **`/workflows:plan` brainstorm integration** — When plan finds a brainstorm document, it now heavily references it throughout. Added `origin:` frontmatter field to plan templates, brainstorm cross-check in final review, and "Sources" section at the bottom of all three plan templates (MINIMAL, MORE, A LOT). Brainstorm decisions are carried forward with explicit references (`see brainstorm: <path>`) and a mandatory scan before finalizing ensures nothing is dropped.

---

## [2.35.1] - 2026-02-18

### Changed

- **`/workflows:work` system-wide test check** — Added "System-Wide Test Check" to the task execution loop. Before marking a task done, forces five questions: what callbacks/middleware fire when this runs? Do tests exercise the real chain or just mocked isolation? Can failure leave orphaned state? What other interfaces need the same change? Do error strategies align across layers? Includes skip criteria for leaf-node changes. Also added integration test guidance to the "Test Continuously" section.
- **`/workflows:plan` system-wide impact templates** — Added "System-Wide Impact" section to MORE and A LOT plan templates (interaction graph, error propagation, state lifecycle, API surface parity, integration test scenarios) as lightweight prompts to flag risks during planning.

---

## [2.35.0] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- **`/lfg` and `/slfg` first-run failures** — Made ralph-loop step optional with graceful fallback when `ralph-wiggum` skill is not installed (#154). Added explicit "do not stop" instruction across all steps (#134).
- **`/workflows:plan` not writing file in pipeline** — Added mandatory "Write Plan File" step with explicit Write tool instructions before Post-Generation Options. The file is now always written to disk before any interactive prompts (#155). Also adds pipeline-mode note to skip AskUserQuestion calls when invoked from LFG/SLFG (#134).
- **Agent namespace typo in `/workflows:plan`** — `Task spec-flow-analyzer(...)` now uses the full qualified name `Task compound-engineering:workflow:spec-flow-analyzer(...)` to prevent Claude from prepending the wrong `workflows:` prefix (#193).

---

## [2.34.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- **Gemini CLI target** — New converter target for [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli). Install with `--to gemini` to convert agents to `.gemini/skills/*/SKILL.md`, commands to `.gemini/commands/*.toml` (TOML format with `description` + `prompt`), and MCP servers to `.gemini/settings.json`. Skills pass through unchanged (identical SKILL.md standard). Namespaced commands create directory structure (`workflows:plan` → `commands/workflows/plan.toml`). 29 new tests. ([#190](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/pull/190))

---

## [2.33.1] - 2026-02-13

### Changed

- **`/workflows:plan` command** - All plan templates now include `status: active` in YAML frontmatter. Plans are created with `status: active` and marked `status: completed` when work finishes.
- **`/workflows:work` command** - Phase 4 now updates plan frontmatter from `status: active` to `status: completed` after shipping. Agents can grep for status to distinguish current vs historical plans.

---

## [2.33.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **`setup` skill** — Interactive configurator for review agents
  - Auto-detects project type (Rails, Python, TypeScript, etc.)
  - Two paths: "Auto-configure" (one click) or "Customize" (pick stack, focus areas, depth)
  - Writes `compound-engineering.local.md` in project root (tool-agnostic — works for Claude, Codex, OpenCode)
  - Invoked automatically by `/workflows:review` when no settings file exists
- **`learnings-researcher` in `/workflows:review`** — Always-run agent that searches `docs/solutions/` for past issues related to the PR
- **`schema-drift-detector` wired into `/workflows:review`** — Conditional agent for PRs with migrations

### Changed

- **`/workflows:review`** — Now reads review agents from `compound-engineering.local.md` settings file. Falls back to invoking setup skill if no file exists.
- **`/workflows:work`** — Review agents now configurable via settings file
- **`/release-docs` command** — Moved from plugin to local `.claude/commands/` (repo maintenance, not distributed)

### Removed

- **`/technical_review` command** — Superseded by configurable review agents

---

## [2.32.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Factory Droid target** — New converter target for [Factory Droid](https://docs.factory.ai). Install with `--to droid` to output agents, commands, and skills to `~/.factory/`.

([#174](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/pull/174))

---

## [2.31.1] - 2026-02-09

### Changed

- **`dspy-ruby` skill** — Complete rewrite to DSPy.rb v0.34.3 API: `.call()` / `result.field` patterns, `T::Enum` classes, `DSPy::Tools::Base` / `Toolset`. Added events system, lifecycle callbacks, fiber-local LM context, GEPA optimization, evaluation framework, typed context pattern, BAML/TOON schema formats, storage system, score reporting, RubyLLM adapter. 5 reference files (2 new: toolsets, observability), 3 asset templates rewritten.

## [2.31.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- **`document-review` skill** — Brainstorm and plan refinement through structured review ([@Trevin Chow](https://github.com/trevin))
- **`/sync` command** — Sync Claude Code personal config across machines ([@Terry Li](https://github.com/terryli))

### Changed

- **Context token optimization (79% reduction)** — Plugin was consuming 316% of the context description budget, causing Claude Code to silently exclude components. Now at 65% with room to grow:
  - All 29 agent descriptions trimmed from ~1,400 to ~180 chars avg (examples moved to agent body)
  - 18 manual commands marked `disable-model-invocation: true` (side-effect commands like `/lfg`, `/deploy-docs`, `/triage`, etc.)
  - 6 manual skills marked `disable-model-invocation: true` (`orchestrating-swarms`, `git-worktree`, `skill-creator`, `compound-docs`, `file-todos`, `resolve-pr-parallel`)
- **git-worktree**: Remove confirmation prompt for worktree creation ([@Sam Xie](https://github.com/XSAM))
- **Prevent subagents from writing intermediary files** in compound workflow ([@Trevin Chow](https://github.com/trevin))

### Fixed

- Fix crash when hook entries have no matcher ([@Roberto Mello](https://github.com/robertomello))
- Fix git-worktree detection where `.git` is a file, not a directory ([@David Alley](https://github.com/davidalley))
- Backup existing config files before overwriting in sync ([@Zac Williams](https://github.com/zacwilliams))
- Note new repository URL ([@Aarni Koskela](https://github.com/aarnikoskela))
- Plugin component counts corrected: 29 agents, 24 commands, 18 skills

## [2.19.0] - 2025-12-31

### Added

- **`/deepen-plan` command** - Power enhancement for plans. Takes an existing plan and runs parallel research sub-agents for each major section to add:
  - Best practices and industry patterns
  - Performance optimizations
  - UI/UX improvements (if applicable)
  - Quality enhancements and edge cases
  - Real-world implementation examples

  The result is a deeply grounded, production-ready plan with concrete implementation details.

### Changed

## [2.18.0] - 2025-12-25

### Added

- **`agent-native-architecture` skill** - Added **Dynamic Capability Discovery** pattern and **Architecture Review Checklist**:

  **New Patterns in mcp-tool-design.md:**
  - **Dynamic Capability Discovery** - For external APIs (HealthKit, HomeKit, GraphQL), build a discovery tool (`list_*`) that returns available capabilities at runtime, plus a generic access tool that takes strings (not enums). The API validates, not your code. This means agents can use new API capabilities without code changes.
  - **CRUD Completeness** - Every entity the agent can create must also be readable, updatable, and deletable. Incomplete CRUD = broken action parity.

  **New in SKILL.md:**
  - **Architecture Review Checklist** - Pushes reviewer findings earlier into the design phase. Covers tool design (dynamic vs static, CRUD completeness), action parity (capability map, edit/delete), UI integration (agent → UI communication), and context injection.
  - **Option 11: API Integration** - New intake option for connecting to external APIs like HealthKit, HomeKit, GraphQL
  - **New anti-patterns:** Static Tool Mapping (building individual tools for each API endpoint), Incomplete CRUD (create-only tools)
  - **Tool Design Criteria** section added to success criteria checklist

  **New in shared-workspace-architecture.md:**
  - **iCloud File Storage for Multi-Device Sync** - Use iCloud Documents for your shared workspace to get free, automatic multi-device sync without building a sync layer. Includes implementation pattern, conflict handling, entitlements, and when NOT to use it.

### Philosophy

This update codifies a key insight for **agent-native apps**: when integrating with external APIs where the agent should have the same access as the user, use **Dynamic Capability Discovery** instead of static tool mapping. Instead of building `read_steps`, `read_heart_rate`, `read_sleep`... build `list_health_types` + `read_health_data(dataType: string)`. The agent discovers what's available, the API validates the type.

Note: This pattern is specifically for agent-native apps following the "whatever the user can do, the agent can do" philosophy. For constrained agents with intentionally limited capabilities, static tool mapping may be appropriate.

---

## [2.17.0] - 2025-12-25

### Enhanced

- **`agent-native-architecture` skill** - Major expansion based on real-world learnings from building the Every Reader iOS app. Added 5 new reference documents and expanded existing ones:

  **New References:**
  - **dynamic-context-injection.md** - How to inject runtime app state into agent system prompts. Covers context injection patterns, what context to inject (resources, activity, capabilities, vocabulary), implementation patterns for Swift/iOS and TypeScript, and context freshness.
  - **action-parity-discipline.md** - Workflow for ensuring agents can do everything users can do. Includes capability mapping templates, parity audit process, PR checklists, tool design for parity, and context parity guidelines.
  - **shared-workspace-architecture.md** - Patterns for agents and users working in the same data space. Covers directory structure, file tools, UI integration (file watching, shared stores), agent-user collaboration patterns, and security considerations.
  - **agent-native-testing.md** - Testing patterns for agent-native apps. Includes "Can Agent Do It?" tests, the Surprise Test, automated parity testing, integration testing, and CI/CD integration.
  - **mobile-patterns.md** - Mobile-specific patterns for iOS/Android. Covers background execution (checkpoint/resume), permission handling, cost-aware design (model tiers, token budgets, network awareness), offline handling, and battery awareness.

  **Updated References:**
  - **architecture-patterns.md** - Added 3 new patterns: Unified Agent Architecture (one orchestrator, many agent types), Agent-to-UI Communication (shared data store, file watching, event bus), and Model Tier Selection (fast/balanced/powerful).

  **Updated Skill Root:**
  - **SKILL.md** - Expanded intake menu (now 10 options including context injection, action parity, shared workspace, testing, mobile patterns). Added 5 new agent-native anti-patterns (Context Starvation, Orphan Features, Sandbox Isolation, Silent Actions, Capability Hiding). Expanded success criteria with agent-native and mobile-specific checklists.

- **`agent-native-reviewer` agent** - Significantly enhanced with comprehensive review process covering all new patterns. Now checks for action parity, context parity, shared workspace, tool design (primitives vs workflows), dynamic context injection, and mobile-specific concerns. Includes detailed anti-patterns, output format template, quick checks ("Write to Location" test, Surprise test), and mobile-specific verification.

### Philosophy

These updates operationalize a key insight from building agent-native mobile apps: **"The agent should be able to do anything the user can do, through tools that mirror UI capabilities, with full context about the app state."** The failure case that prompted these changes: an agent asked "what reading feed?" when a user said "write something in my reading feed"—because it had no `publish_to_feed` tool and no context about what "feed" meant.

## [2.16.0] - 2025-12-21

### Enhanced

- **`dhh-rails-style` skill** - Massively expanded reference documentation incorporating patterns from Marc Köhlbrugge's Unofficial 37signals Coding Style Guide:
  - **controllers.md** - Added authorization patterns, rate limiting, Sec-Fetch-Site CSRF protection, request context concerns
  - **models.md** - Added validation philosophy, let it crash philosophy (bang methods), default values with lambdas, Rails 7.1+ patterns (normalizes, delegated types, store accessor), concern guidelines with touch chains
  - **frontend.md** - Added Turbo morphing best practices, Turbo frames patterns, 6 new Stimulus controllers (auto-submit, dialog, local-time, etc.), Stimulus best practices, view helpers, caching with personalization, broadcasting patterns
  - **architecture.md** - Added path-based multi-tenancy, database patterns (UUIDs, state as records, hard deletes, counter caches), background job patterns (transaction safety, error handling, batch processing), email patterns, security patterns (XSS, SSRF, CSP), Active Storage patterns
  - **gems.md** - Added expanded what-they-avoid section (service objects, form objects, decorators, CSS preprocessors, React/Vue), testing philosophy with Minitest/fixtures patterns
