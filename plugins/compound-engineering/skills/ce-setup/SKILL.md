# Compound Engineering Setup

## Interaction Method

Ask the user each question below using the platform's blocking question tool (e.g., `AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code, `request_user_input` in Codex, `ask_user` in Gemini). If no structured question tool is available, present each question as a numbered list and wait for a reply before proceeding. For multiSelect questions, accept comma-separated numbers (e.g. `1, 3`). Never skip or auto-configure.

Interactive setup for compound-engineering — diagnoses environment health, cleans obsolete repo-local CE config, and helps configure required tools. Review agent selection is handled automatically by `ce:review`; project-specific review guidance belongs in `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`.

## Phase 1: Diagnose

### Step 1: Determine Plugin Version

Detect the installed compound-engineering plugin version by reading the plugin metadata or manifest. This is platform-specific -- use whatever mechanism is available (e.g., reading `plugin.json` from the plugin root or cache directory). If the version cannot be determined, skip this step.

If a version is found, pass it to the check script via `--version`. Otherwise omit the flag.

### Step 2: Run the Health Check Script

Run the bundled check script. Do not perform manual dependency checks -- the script handles all CLI tools, repo-local CE file checks, and `.gitignore` guidance in one pass.

```bash
bash scripts/check-health --version VERSION
```

Or without version if Step 1 could not determine it:

```bash
bash scripts/check-health
```

Script reference: `scripts/check-health`

Display the script's output to the user.

### Step 3: Evaluate Results

**Platform detection (pre-resolved):** !`[ -n "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}" ] && echo "CLAUDE_CODE" || echo "OTHER"`

If the line above resolved to `CLAUDE_CODE`, this is a Claude Code session and `/ce-update` is available. Otherwise, omit any `/ce-update` references from output.

After the diagnostic report, check whether:

- any dependencies are missing (reported as red in the script output)
- `compound-engineering.local.md` is present and needs cleanup
- `.compound-engineering/config.local.yaml` does not exist or is not safely gitignored

If everything is installed, no repo-local cleanup is needed, and `.compound-engineering/config.local.yaml` already exists and is gitignored, display:

```
Everything looks good -- all tools installed, config in place.
Run /ce-setup anytime to re-check dependencies.
Setup complete.
```

If this is a Claude Code session, append to the message: "Run /ce-update to grab the latest plugin version."

Stop here.

Otherwise proceed to Phase 2 to resolve any issues. Handle repo-local cleanup (Step 4) first, then config bootstrapping (Step 5), then missing dependencies (Step 6).

## Phase 2: Fix

### Step 4: Resolve Repo-Local CE Issues

If `compound-engineering.local.md` exists, explain that it is obsolete because review-agent selection is automatic and CE now uses `.compound-engineering/config.local.yaml` for any surviving machine-local state. Ask whether to delete it now.

### Step 5: Bootstrap Project Config

If `.compound-engineering/config.local.yaml` does not exist in the current repo, ask whether to create it:

```
Set up a local config file for this project?
This saves your Compound Engineering preferences (like which tools to use and how workflows behave).
Everything starts commented out -- you only enable what you need.

1. Yes, create it (Recommended)
2. No thanks
```

If the user approves:

1. Create the `.compound-engineering/` directory if it does not exist.
2. Copy the template from `references/config-template.yaml` to `.compound-engineering/config.local.yaml`.
3. If `.compound-engineering/config.local.yaml` is not already covered by `.gitignore`, offer to add the entry:

```text
.compound-engineering/config.local.yaml
```

If the file already exists, check whether it is safely gitignored. If not, offer to add the `.gitignore` entry as above.

### Step 6: Offer Installation

Present the missing dependencies grouped by tier using a multiSelect question. Pre-select recommended items. Use the install commands and URLs from the script's diagnostic output.

```
The following tools are missing. Select which to install:
(Recommended items are pre-selected)

Recommended:
  [x] agent-browser - Browser automation for testing and screenshots
  [x] gh - GitHub CLI for issues and PRs
  [x] jq - JSON processor

Optional:
  [ ] rtk - Token optimization CLI (60-90% savings)
```

Only show dependencies that are actually missing. Omit installed ones.

### Step 7: Install Selected Dependencies

For each selected dependency, in order:

1. **Show the install command** (from the diagnostic output) and ask for approval:

   ```
   Install agent-browser?
   Command: npm install -g agent-browser && agent-browser install

   1. Run this command
   2. Skip - I'll install it manually
   ```

2. **If approved:** Run the install command using a shell execution tool. After the command completes, verify installation by running the dependency's check command (e.g., `command -v agent-browser`).

3. **If verification succeeds:** Report success.

4. **If verification fails or install errors:** Display the project URL as fallback and continue to the next dependency.

### Step 8: Summary

Display a brief summary:

```
Setup complete.
  Installed: agent-browser, gh, jq
  Skipped:   rtk

Run /ce-setup anytime to re-check dependencies.
```

If this is a Claude Code session (per platform detection in Step 3), append: "Run /ce-update to grab the latest plugin version."
