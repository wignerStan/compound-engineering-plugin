# Compounding Engineering Plugin

AI-powered development tools that get smarter with every use. Make each unit of engineering work easier than the last.

## Getting Started

After installing, run `/ce-setup` in any project. It diagnoses your environment, installs missing tools, and bootstraps project config in one interactive flow.
