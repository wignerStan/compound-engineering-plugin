## Commands

### All-in-One Workflow

Run a complete engineering workflow from feature description to PR:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/lfg [description]` | Right-sized workflow: routes to direct edit, lightweight execution, or full pipeline based on task complexity |
| `/slfg [description]` | Same routing with parallel execution via swarm mode for standard/complex tasks |

Both assess task complexity and choose the right amount of ceremony. Trivial fixes (typos, renames) execute directly. Bounded tasks with clear requirements skip planning and multi-agent review. Complex or ambiguous tasks run the full pipeline: `brainstorm → plan → work → review → resolve todos → test → video`. All three routes still preserve the branch/commit/PR lifecycle. `/slfg` parallelizes where possible using swarm agents.

### Step-by-Step Workflow

Use individual commands when you want control over specific phases. Core workflow commands use the `ce:` prefix:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ce:ideate` | Discover high-impact project improvements through divergent ideation and adversarial filtering |
| `/ce:brainstorm` | Explore requirements and approaches before planning |
| `/ce:plan` | Transform features into structured implementation plans grounded in repo patterns |
| `/ce:review` | Run comprehensive code reviews |
| `/ce:work` | Execute work items systematically |
| `/ce:compound` | Document solved problems to compound team knowledge |
| `/ce:compound-refresh` | Refresh stale or drifting learnings and decide whether to keep, update, replace, or archive them |

Step-by-step is useful when you want to brainstorm now and plan later, build a plan from an existing requirements doc, run just a review, or document a fix.

### Utility Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/deepen-plan` | Stress-test plans and deepen weak sections with targeted research |
| `/changelog` | Create engaging changelogs for recent merges |
| `/generate_command` | Generate new slash commands |
| `/sync` | Sync Claude Code config across machines |
| `/report-bug-ce` | Report a bug in the compound-engineering plugin |
| `/reproduce-bug` | Reproduce bugs using logs and console |
| `/resolve-pr-parallel` | Resolve PR comments in parallel |
| `/resolve-todo-parallel` | Resolve todos in parallel |
| `/triage` | Triage and prioritize issues |
| `/test-browser` | Run browser tests on PR-affected pages |
| `/test-xcode` | Build and test iOS apps on simulator |
| `/feature-video` | Record video walkthroughs and add to PR description |

**gemini-imagegen features:**
- Text-to-image generation
- Image editing and manipulation
- Multi-turn refinement
- Multiple reference image composition (up to 14 images)

**Requirements:**
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable
- Python packages: `google-genai`, `pillow`

## MCP Servers

| Server | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `context7` | Framework documentation lookup via Context7 |

### Context7

**Tools provided:**
- `resolve-library-id` - Find library ID for a framework/package
- `get-library-docs` - Get documentation for a specific library

Supports 100+ frameworks including Rails, React, Next.js, Vue, Django, Laravel, and more.

MCP servers start automatically when the plugin is enabled.

**Authentication:** To avoid anonymous rate limits, set the `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` environment variable with your Context7 API key. The plugin passes this automatically via the `x-api-key` header. Without it, requests go unauthenticated and will quickly hit the anonymous quota limit.

## Browser Automation

This plugin uses **agent-browser CLI** for browser automation tasks. Install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g agent-browser
agent-browser install  # Downloads Chromium
```

The `agent-browser` skill provides comprehensive documentation on usage.

## Installation

```bash
claude /plugin install compound-engineering
```

## Known Issues

### MCP Servers Not Auto-Loading

**Issue:** The bundled Context7 MCP server may not load automatically when the plugin is installed.

**Workaround:** Manually add it to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "x-api-key": "${CONTEXT7_API_KEY:-}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Set `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` in your environment to authenticate. Or add it globally in `~/.claude/settings.json` for all projects.
